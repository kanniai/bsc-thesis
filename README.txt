Here are the data processing scripts for BSc Thesis in Spring 2021

The data used in this thesis is acquired from Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse (THEW) data administrated by 
the University of Rochester Medical Center. The data is not publicly available, but it can be accessed
free by non-profit organizations. In the Thesis, the data have been aquired by the Computational Physics 
laboratory at Tampere University.

Therefore the scripts are not functional, because data is not included in the repository. Instead, the 
edited codes are used in BSc Thesis: http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:tuni-202105165047
Some case-by-case edits have been made to produce satisfying results eligible for the thesis.
